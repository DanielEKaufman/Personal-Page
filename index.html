          <h1>About</h1>
          My name is Dan Kaufman.  I seek challenges and problems to solve.  I have 
          found that computer science and nature offer a multitude of opportunities 
          for both.
          <br>
          <br>
          In December 2011, I graduated from the <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois (UIUC)</a> with 
          a degree in Computer Science.  I now live in San Francisco where I have been 
          working on some side projects and exploring roles that ride the line 
          between product and engineering.

          This iPhone app will allow users to leave virtual content at a specific
          GPS locations and deliver it when the recipient arrives at the location. 
          Some potential uses include: leaving a comment or pictures, creating interactive 
          tours, or leaving a digital gift for a friend to find. Currently, 
          I have built out the core functionality, location-based notifications. 
          Next steps include building a user interface that allows users to leave 
          and receive content, adding authentication, and optimization of the 
          location-based features.

          This app allows users to create a to-do list that updates in real-time 
          for all users. Users are able to add and remove items, as well as easily
          share it with their friends. This initial version gave me an opportunity 
          learn more about Node.js and the Websockets protocol.  In the future,  
          I plan to add a Facebook authenticated login and updated design.

          Accessing the backup data from an iPhone isn't the most straightforward 
          thing in the world.  After tracking down the correct SQLite files, I 
          was able to figure out how the tables are joined and I have created 
          functions to access this information.  Thus far I have only examined trends 
          using graphing capabilities of Excel, but it is definitely interesting to 
          see how friendships evolve in terms of text message frequency.

          I made this visualization as part of a group project that focused on designing
          a tool that helped a user create effective groups based on self-determined skills. 
          I created the application with <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> and used 
          <a href="http://processingjs.org/">ProcessingJS</a> to display it on an HTML5 canvas.

          This is an Android application that allows a user to hold a phone up to the face

          This application allowed users to view, create, and delete their Facebook events in a calendar format.
          I was in charge of the Facebook integration and built a number of different classes to interact with 
          one of the first versions of the Facebook API. The calendar began as a project for CS 242 - Programming Studio built by myself,

          This prototype was a project for CS465 - Principles of User Interface Design, Implementation and Evaluation.

          The purpose of the project was primarily focused on the process of user interface design, rather than the

          2010 at Illinois. The application helped students at the University of Illinois get into classes currently
          full by monitoring course registration system. Students were able to enter the course number of the desired 
          class and receive email notifications as soon as another student dropped the course.

        Despite growing up in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/xsHVR" target="_blank">Danvers, IL</a>, 
        surrounded by cornfields, I developed a love for the mountains. Whether I am 
        climbing up them, skiing down them, or biking on them, some of the happiest 
        moments of my life have been in the mountains. The following are some of my adventures.

        <div class = "sub_header">Ouray Ice Fest - Jan 2013</div>
        <hr>
        <p1>
          The <a href="http://ourayicepark.com/ice-festival/" target="_blank">Ouray Ice Fest</a> 
          The Ouray Ice Fest is one of my favorite extreme sports festivals. Complete with
          parties, presentations, hot springs, and, of course, hours of ice climbing, it's
          hard to beat. Having attended the Ouray Ice Fest twice before, my friends and 
          I decided to change things up this year. Instead of cramming 6 people into one 
          hotel room, as we had in the past, we decided to rent a condo for the weekend. 
          While the cost is slightly more, I definitely recommend this option for the future. 
          <img src="images/ouray_ice_2013_bridge.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          This is one of the main bridges that crosses the canyon. Gravity fed water pipes 
          line nearly a mile of the canyon rim and provide water for the ice generation. 
          Every night, between the hours of 4pm and 8am, water runs through 150 shower, 
          heads adding a fresh layer of ice. 
          <img src="images/ouray_ice_2013_climbing.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          On the route above, we had to belay from the top because the wall was too tall 
          for our ropes. Jason set up a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NrsNhmf3rQ">
            top belay</a> that was a little more complex, but very effective. Since we were 
          belaying from the top, we had to be lowered into the canyon, then climb out. 
          Unsure of what waited below, and with all climbing companions waiting above, it 
          was one of the most nerve wracking climbs I have done.
          <img src="images/ouray_ice_2013_temp.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          Obviously for an ice festival it would have to be really cold, but lacing on 
          your boots at dawn with the temperature of -6 is very unpleasant. 
          <img src="images/ouray_ice_2013_puffy.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          Nearly every major brand in outdoor adventure gear is represented at the ice fest,
          bringing with them their latest and greatest gear.  Everything from crampons to 
          ice tools, and coats to backpacks may be demoed. I decided to demo a very, very 
          warm Rab puffy, which definitely helped to keep me warm. 
          <img src="images/ouray_ice_2013_friends_1.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          While I love climbing and being outside, one of the main reasons I go on adventures 
          like this is the chance to spend time with friends.

          One of my close friends, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/benj.ritter" target="_blank">Ben Ritter</a>
          , and I have  some mountaineering experience, but this trip opened our eyes 
          to a number of other things that we were not prepared 
          for.  First of all, how to rescue each other in the event that one of us fell 
          into a crevasse.  Fortunately this didn&#39;t happen, but it is important to be prepared.
          Below is one of the diagrams that we found to help explain the proper setup.  Keep in 
          mind that while you are setting that up, the person in the crevasse is hanging from your 
          harness and pulling you in.
          <img src="images/two_person_rescue.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          <img src="images/shasta_base.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          The weather looked pretty good, but there was a forecast for high winds.  We
          decided to try and go for it regardless.
          <img src="images/shasta_tent.png" class="content_img" height="80%">
          We reached 10,000 feet by about 6 pm and began to set up our campsite. The 
          wind was blowing very hard so we found a large boulder to shelter us from 
          the wind. When that proved insufficient, we decided to build a snow wall 
          to provide further protection. After cooking a quick dinner, we got ready for 
          bed around 8 pm, with our alarms set for an alpine start at 2 am. Shivering 
          in our sleeping bags, hoping that the seams on the tent would hold, we spent
          the next 6 hours with less than 15 minutes of sleep. Due to the strong winds 
          we decided to postpone our start till 3 am. We emerged from our tent only to 
          see the winds ripping over the corniced summit. After little deliberation, we 
          opted to play it safe and pass on our summit attempt. After a short nap we 
          packed up our site, and glissaded down the glacier, heading for the car.
